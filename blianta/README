This is stuff to update the year articles on wikipedia.

To update year pages with new births and deaths
(good to do after substantial work on WD descriptions, e.g.)

First make sure that current year is at bottom of years.txt (not added
automatically!)

$ make clean
$ make
(takes 2+ hours)

Quality control:
$ egrep '(Q[0-9]+)[[:space:]].*\1' *.tsv
(finds any examples with a missing Irish label)

$ egrep 'NONE' *.tsv
(finds any examples with a missing Irish description — many!)

(can fix what I want in Wikidata and then re-run,
but note it's also OK to just leave these in *.tsv since
the bliain.py script knows to ignore these).

Then copy bas.tsv and breith.tsv over to laptop

Note there is some weirdness with Gregorian vs. Julian dates, 
e.g. dáta báis Robert Bruce which "appears" on Wikidata as 7 Meitheamh
but comes through this scripts as 15 Meitheamh!

Run on laptop as

$ python dates.py blianta breith dryrun
$ python dates.py blianta bas dryrun
$ python dates.py laethanta breith dryrun
$ python dates.py laethanta bas dryrun

(good to pipe through "more" for the dryrun...)

And then with "live" in place of "dryrun"
